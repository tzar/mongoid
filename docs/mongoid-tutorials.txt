Mongoid (6.0.0)

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Mongoid documentation has the following tutorials:

.. COMMENT Consider moving the toc landing pages to docs-ruby instead.
.. Pros: 
      Avoid the somewhat unwieldy toc structure below which requires regexing of "version" during the build process.
      Easier to maintain and update structure of the docs
   Cons:
      Odd that one or two pages (albeit only toc pages) wouldn't be together.
      If we add new page, the toc tree page is in the repo with the new page.
